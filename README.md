- Rather than showing the option to watch/favorite movies to unauthorized users, it's not shown at all.
- Watch option is also disabled for movies which require prime. Once user has aquired it, he has watch access to all the movies.
- There's two users, only admin has access to the admin tab:
Username: admin
Password: admin
and
Username: user
Password: user
